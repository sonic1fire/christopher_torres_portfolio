<h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don't have a traditional pathway when it comes too education and college. I graduated highschool in 2018 than was lost I wasn't sure what to do but I knew that my love for computers was forever evermore</p>
		<p>Since I was a kid I've always been tinkering with computers and devices. My first time actually breaking a computer was when I wanted too play a sonic game on my dads first ever gateway desktop that he found</p>
		<p> I remember seeing the screen just going blank clicking on stuff and running away. than he took it to the bronx. Specifically to his cousins house and I saw this guy drinking an energy drink and restarting the desktop</p>
		<p>But as a kid I thought this was the ultimate repair. Seeing him install windows xp made me think to myself... hey I could do that and better than him and my dad would show me and let me mess with computers he would find</p>
		<p>in the trash or at work and let me learn or in other words do whatever and when I would mess up he would come and share his wisdom and I would take that and expand on it and eventually surprise him with a working computer</p>
		<p>and sometimes too improve speeds overclock whatever I could, Msconfig and unlock all the processors or use hardrive as VRAM etc, than I remember reading about youtube in a book in elementary school and that was the </p>
		<p>Equivalent of a masters degree too me in like 5th grade maybe 6th but around that time and when I went to trade school after graduating because my brother who dropped out of highschool wanted to get his GED I followed him</p>
		<p>and entered Coop-Tech where I realized I am actually really, really good at computers compared too my peers and was selected to compete in Skills USA and got 2nd place over a micro error but still good enough than entered</p>
		<p>states and failed but that's a story for another time. This is a mini introduction to who I am and my passion of computers and the rest could most likely be in a book I am writing about my life.</p>
